Welcome to the W5133 Research Group
====================================

The core mission of the W4133 research group (and all prior iterations) has been to contribute to advances in the theory and empirical application of economic valuation of nonmarket goods and services.  These values are essential inputs to decision-making for public policy that attempt to balance sustainable economic development, rural livelihoods, environmental quality, natural resource use, and conservation goals to support a variety of societal needs. The USDA, through its support of W4133 (and proposed W5133) objectives, is at the forefront in recognizing the need for the improvement of valuation methods, increasing the range of ecosystem service valuation applications, and the development and testing of policy instruments that use valuation information in efforts to efficiently allocate nonmarket ecosystem goods and services.
